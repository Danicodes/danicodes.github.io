<i>(Everyone loves dining hall food)</i>

It should come as no surprise to most Grinnellians that we are really being
stinted when it comes to the paying for our semesterly meal plans at the college.
How much exactly are we paying and how much **should** we be paying?

After a friend from class brought up his initial calculations, I thought it
might be worth looking into this injustice -- then I realized
[Joe Wlos '15](http://gumag.net/dont-choose-your-dining-plan-yet/) had the same
idea. So I'm just going to expand on some of the
things he brought up in the GUM article.
****
**Cost of Plan versus Cost at the Door**

How much money would we gain (or lose) if we decided to buy the same amount of
meals offered by our plans at the door.

**Price per Meal to Amount of Meals per Semester**

*(aside: I really like these bubble visualizations)*

The size of the bubbles indicate how many meals per semester the plan covers,
while (as indicated by the legend) the darker color indicates a higher price per
meal that the plan covers.

This should immediately indicate to you, my friends on the **10 Plus** meal plan,
that we got the shortest possible end of the stick. We've got a midsized number
of meals and yet we are effectively paying **$20.25 PER MEAL.**

I also figured it might be worth looking at how much students at other similar
schools are paying for their meals. Similar colleges meaning small, mid-west colleges.

I'm sure the operating costs of the dining hall are through the roof but there
are certainly still some policies that they could implement to make it fair on
the student body. Upon inspection of other schools meal plans, I found that
most dining halls allow meals to roll over into the following weeks.
There are simple policies that the dining hall could easily implement that
would benefit most of the student body without being taxing on the staff.
