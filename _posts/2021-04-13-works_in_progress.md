# What Am I Up To?
It's been a while and a lot of empty space on this website.

Here's a brief timeline of things I've done since 2016:

2017
- My first Data Engineer job
- Began learning all that comes with the first dev job and how to work in a production env
- Getting familiar with UNIX, JIRA, Git and better programming practices

2018
- Lots of Data Driven meetups
- I played way more tennis this year for some reason
- Tmux changed my life

2019
- Got to attend a few weeks of cybersecurity lectures at NYU as a guest
- Tried to get a few project collaboration groups started; ended up fizzling out when
  we couldn't agree on a project to actually start
- Began more consistently attending the weekly Python meetup group

2020
- Took an online Database course for a more in-depth understanding of data management
- Started meditating to cope with _everything_
- Started streaming myself programming on Twitch, and watching programming streams on Twitch
- Began hosting a weekly algorithms group for programmers with varying experience
- Started building a community of creative programmers that inspired me to try some new things
- Began using NeoVim

2021
- Even more I hope

# Where Are The Projects?
I'm still trying to be brave enough to put works in progress up on github.
I'm constantly getting new ideas and it's making the old ideas suffer!
I can't get some of these ideas "done" as fast as I'd like but I'd at least like to spend more time
documenting my learning and experimentation. And hopefully others may find it useful too.

I stream some casual code on [Twitch](www.twitch.tv/girlwithbox), which has been an amazing outlet for being creative and learning. I've spent my coding streams so far making some fun and silly things to escape from a not-so-fun year.

# Coming Soon:
Here are a few things I plan to write about!
- Adventures in Async
- Guide to Get Started with Neovim
- Twitch Plays Mortal Kombat (Badly)
- Improving Twitter Search
- How to Use Data for Good
